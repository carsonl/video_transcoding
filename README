Original How To: https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding

Modify print-instance-args_main.sh to include a volume where the video content is.

Build with ./build.sh (or rebuild with ./rebuild.sh)
Run with ./run.sh

Kill with ./kill.sh
Remove with ./rm.sh
Watch logs with ./logs

Attach to the running container with ./debug.sh
Split out the container ID with ./check.sh (This one is also used by some of my other scripts to determine if it is running)
