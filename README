Original How To: https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding

Build with ./build.sh
Run with ./run.sh <Directory containing video(s)>

Kill with ./kill.sh
Remove with ./rm.sh
Watch logs with ./logs

Attach to the running container with ./debug.sh
Split out the container ID with ./check.sh (This one is also used by some of my other scripts to determine if it is running)
